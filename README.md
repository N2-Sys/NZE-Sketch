### Compile the program

You can compile the program with the shell script:

```shell
$ ./build.sh
```

You can also run the following constructions:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ mkdir bin
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DEXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH=../bin && make
```

Then, the executable file is in the `bin` directory.

**Note: After changing the parameters in `parameters.h`, you need to re-execute the `make` command.**

&nbsp;

### Run the program

You can run the program with the following constructions:

```shell
$ cd bin
$ ./seq [Optional: path_of_the_data]
```

 or:

```
./bin/seq path_of_the_data
```

The default dataset is in the `data` directory.

You can also generate your own data with the [pcap parser](https://github.com/Dustin-He/PcapParser).
